# Robot Framework Samples
This project aims at covering all ground w.r.t Robot framework.

## What is robotframework
Robot Framework is a generic open source automation framework. It can be used for test automation and robotic process automation (RPA). [You can read more about it here](https://robotframework.org/).

This framework can be used to automate both User Interface and API. This repo aims at picking up random test cases and automating them. One of the example is `fakestore api`. This wonderful set of people created a useful API gateway for budding developers and I am utilizing it to build a project automating/testing it.

## System setup
- OS: Windows 10
- Python: 3.10.x
- Robot Framework: 6.0.1
